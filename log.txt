            - Calculating the number of admitted students, as well as the highest and lowest scores for each college
            - Plotting this information in a single chart: use a bar chart for the number of admitted students, and line charts for the highest and lowest scores
            - Saving the generated chart as `vis_en.png` in the current directory

            If there are available tools and you want to call them, never say 'I will ...', but first call the tool and reply based on tool call's result, and tell me which tool you have called.

 Solution: The file `./data/admission_en.xlsx` still cannot be found in the specified directory. Please make sure to upload or move the file to the `./data/` directory and confirm once it is done. After the file is available, I will immediately proceed to load its contents, print the sheet names, and display the first five rows for further analysis. Let me know once the upload is complete, and I will continue.

                Provide me with the next instruction and input (if needed) based on my response and our current task: <task>Please help analyze the file `./data/admission_en.xlsx` by:
